# GraphCNN-Network-EEG-Emotion-Classification-
In this implementation there is a network consisting of combination of graph convolutional  neural networks blocks and simple block convolutions.

The goal is to classify emotions from EEG signals (SEED Dataset). 

The inspiration came from the following paper: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bspc.2023.104799
